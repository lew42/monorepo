# Check 23 asks against the repo: ext/Figma

You are a checker, not a builder. Do NOT edit any file in the repo. Read ONLY this brief and the repo files named below or found by searching. Write your answers to `public/framework/ai/sessions/2026/10/13/session-730e8a7b/mastermind-repo-slim/verify-undone/batches/06-ext-figma-6/results.json` and stop.

The owner asked for each thing below, and the record says it is still undone. Some are already built and nothing says so. For each ask decide:

- **done**: the thing exists now. Evidence = `path:line` of the code, doc or page that does it, plus the quoted line (under 25 words). A path that does not exist is a failure; open the file and confirm.
- **undone**: you looked and it is not there. Evidence = the three places you looked and what you searched for (the module's readme, its `doc/`, a `grep` for two or three key words, `git log --oneline -n 5 -S"<key word>" -- <dir>`). "I did not find it" with no places named is not allowed.
- **unclear**: the ask is a question, an opinion, a rule about how to work, or too vague to test. Say in one line why.

Be strict: "done" needs a file you opened. A related thing is not the thing. If it is partly built, say **undone** and name what is built and what is missing. Searching hard is cheap; guessing is wrong.

## Where to look

- Module: `ext/Figma`, folder `public/framework/ext/Figma` (the site serves `public/` as `/`).
- Readme chain, root to leaf: `readme.md`, `public/framework/readme.md`, `public/framework/ext/readme.md`, `public/framework/ext/Figma/readme.md`. Also its `doc/`, `tasks/`, `inbox.jsonl`.
- `public/framework/ai/handover.md` and `CLAUDE.md` hold rules that count as "done" for asks about how agents work.
- Use Grep/Glob first; use `git log` sparingly (always with `-n 5` and a path).

## The module's readme (first 70 lines of `public/framework/ext/Figma/readme.md`)

# Figma — tracks Figma files as JSONL + saved screenshots, so the site can browse every page and rebuild designs without Figma

## Use

[Figma guide](/framework/ext/Figma/guide/): how Claude draws in Figma, coded from the 3440 design it drew ([doc/use-figma.md](./doc/use-figma.md)).

Page: [/framework/ext/Figma/](/framework/ext/Figma/) — files, then a file's pages as a preview grid, then one page large with its frames, then its compare view: `/framework/ext/Figma/<file-slug>/`, `.../<file-slug>/<page-slug>/`, `.../<file-slug>/<page-slug>/compare/<frame-slug>/` — real routed pages (`route()`, FigmaFilePage.js/FigmaPagePage.js/FigmaComparePage.js), so reload and back land in the same place. An old `?file=<key>&page=<node id>&compare=<node id>` link still opens — FigmaBrowse.js rewrites it to the real url in place. Rebuilt designs: [Color Schemes](/framework/ext/Figma/colors/), all nine Palette sections from Page 7, starting at [The Approved Schemes](/framework/ext/Figma/palette/) and declared by [palette](/framework/ext/Figma/palette/); plus [Auto layout](/framework/ext/Figma/autolayout/) (Page 8). The rebuilt pages use the site's style system (`--prime`, the four `bg-` grounds, one `.card`; [architecture](/framework/styles/doc/architecture.md)), so they show our accent, not Figma's blue, and keep only the CSS unique to each design. Each browse card shows its Figma shot and, when a page was built from it, a Built page link and a side-by-side Compare view.

Track or refresh a file (the Figma MCP only answers inside an agent session, so an agent supplies a spec of node ids and screenshot URLs; the script computes the rest):

```
node public/framework/ext/Figma/track.mjs spec.json
```

Scripts (run from the repo root): `node public/framework/ext/Figma/built.mjs` maps Figma node ids to built pages (re-run after adding a page); `thumbs.mjs` makes the 480 px card thumbnails; `visibility.mjs` lists any page.js no parent declares (the merge gate runs it, exit 1 if any).

## Classes

- `Figma` (`Figma.js`) — the system; `Figma.files()` loads every tracked file from `index.jsonl`; `files_sync()` is the one blocking read a cold deep link needs.
- `FigmaFile` (`FigmaFile.js`) — one tracked file: key, name, pages; reads `data/<key>/pages.jsonl` (newest line per id wins); gives every page and frame its slug.
- `FigmaNode` (`FigmaNode.js`) — a page or frame: name, size, screenshot, link back to Figma.
- `FigmaBrowse` (`FigmaBrowse.js`) — the files list (`/framework/ext/Figma/`); `route()` hands off to `FigmaFilePage`.
- `FigmaFilePage` / `FigmaPagePage` / `FigmaComparePage` — one file's pages, one page's frames, and the compare view, each its own routed page (`core/Page/dynamic/`).
- `slug.js`, `sync.js`, `grid.js` — the readable-url helper, the cold-deep-link blocking read, and the one card-grid renderer every browse level shares.

## Watch out

- **Figma-specific only.** General design guidance (space, contrast, layout, navigation) lives in the design system, [/framework/design/](/framework/design/), and applies to the browser and to Figma alike. This folder and its docs cover what only exists in Figma: auto layout, components, slots, variables, the MCP. When a finding applies to both, write it in `design/` and link it from here.

- No tool lists a user's files: every fetch needs a file key from a Figma URL. Tracked now: Sept-2026 `QYN0G2URSBHYH5I06MOjxU`.
- Sept-2026 is now also our design file (owner, 2026-10-12): Claude may add pages to it (`Claude · Overview` is the index) and its `prime` variable is the site's `#FF6157`. Leave the owner's own pages (1–8, Vector, Paragraph) as they are. July-2026 stays read only. Load the `figma-use` skill resource before any `use_figma`.
- **The process** (owner, 2026-10-12): design in Figma with the tokens and kit, click through it, approve it, then code it from the approved frame, so there is something tangible to revert to instead of a description.
- **Figma mastermind** (owner, 2026-10-13): one standing session owns the Figma work and keeps this folder's docs current. Figma work needs no worktree; repo edits (docs, `tokens/`) still commit by path, and `tokens/` still goes through review and merge. Pages follow [doc/page-layout.md](./doc/page-layout.md) (one 1920 wrapper, auto layout, the page as a component, an Index page). Edit the main component, never the same override on every instance.
- Screenshots over 600 KB are refused by `track.mjs`; the Figma screenshot URL is short-lived.

## The 23 asks

1. `cd0f220be1` (4 days old): Look through other pages, such as page seven's breakdown of designs, for design data.
2. `f77eeb2b4d` (4 days old): Choose whether to use data already pulled from MCP or call MCP directly.
3. `c7d6218abc` (4 days old): Use the approved color stacking in the root frame on page seven as the source for color pairings.
4. `21cd564c32` (4 days old): Define which color tokens and text schemes work on each background color.
5. `93087eecbb` (4 days old): Limit the color pairings to a specific small number of approved combinations.
6. `3d6088cd50` (3 days old): Explain when to use a Figma slot versus swapping a component, and when to use a nested component instance instead.
7. `4951a37b62` (3 days old): Confirm that a Figma slot detaches a section from its master with no linkage afterward.
8. `308a61bad9` (3 days old): Assess whether a component placed inside a slot gives sub-control over slot content without losing the template link.
9. `3703923dec` (3 days old): Assess the nested component instance with variant switching as an alternative, including the cost of adding a variant to the master for each new page.
10. `5ffcce1e62` (3 days old): Keep templated parts such as page headers as granular components outside the content slot, possibly including a page title component.
11. `78a2599cdb` (3 days old): Keep content inside the slot free, with components such as cards allowed inside it.
12. `029815f46c` (3 days old): Preserve template updates so that changing an underlying templated element updates every page using it.
13. `e78e587285` (3 days old): Use auto layout properly for page templates so the index page shows exactly what exists and how many of each.
14. `1ff76d4742` (3 days old): Keep the current growth behaviour of the layout, which the owner likes.
15. `5149b5a070` (3 days old): Figure out how to make grids in Figma line up so there are no strange voids where items have unequal heights.
16. `bc9cb75f0a` (3 days old): If unequal heights stay, turn the grids into a masonry style, possibly built manually by creating rows and placing items in them.
17. `4edcea19df` (3 days old): Consider a fixed height per row with fill-height items for equal-height cards, accepting that it is less fluid and does not adapt to changing content.
18. `09ec739759` (3 days old): Pay attention to content length at each level (card, section, paragraph) when designing layouts.
19. `3d1587a0f0` (3 days old): Default to adaptive height containers so any content can be placed in them.
20. `5f9500c4cd` (3 days old): Consider top-aligning cards with different amounts of content instead of vertically centring them.
21. `7aab49b5cb` (3 days old): Make index page previews auto height, removing the fixed height, while keeping a consistent shrunk-down size.
22. `ca18b98800` (3 days old): Fix clipped content in specimen cards, including progress bars, and check padding at mobile size using proper padding tokens.
23. `832bfc9e65` (3 days old): Create index2 under the index page with full-size page instances stacked in a padding list wrapper, so 100 percent zoom shows true scale.
